Migrating personal/professional website from prior hosting service to Github.io after original hosting service ceased free hosting services. Opportunity to learn about Jekyll. Learned about using liquid tags.

Future State/Issues to resolve:
 - add other web apps
 - footer is displaying in middle instead of bottom of page.
 - look into using code snippet highlighting using Rogue
