        		<h1>Hi there, I'm Abhijit Khanna!</h1>
				<p>I am seeking to return to more technically focused roles where I can use and grow my development skills. I believe that my experience in business and strategic roles will enable me to add value as a developer who can view my own and my teams' contributions with the lens of how they fit into the context of overall organizational strategy and vision. While I have the most experience working in JavaScript and Python, I am open/eager to learn new technologies. I have an avid interest in how data can be used to support informed decision making as well as machine learning and Internet of Things applications. Culturally, I'm looking for a company that values collaboration and individuals who love to learn as well as share their knowledge. On a more personal note, I enjoy reading, travel, and am passionate about environmental sustainability. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
