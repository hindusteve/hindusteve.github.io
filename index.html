        <h1>Hi there, I'm Abhijit Khanna!</h1>
		<p>I am seeking to return to more technically focused roles where I can use and grow my development skills. I believe that my experience in business and strategic roles will enable me to add value as a developer who can view my own and my teams' contributions with the lens of how they fit into the context of overall organizational strategy and vision. While I have the most experience working in JavaScript and Python, I am open/eager to learn new technologies. I have an avid interest in how data can be used to support informed decision making as well as machine learning and Internet of Things applications. Culturally, I'm looking for a company that values collaboration and individuals who love to learn as well as share their knowledge. On a more personal note, I enjoy reading, travel, and am passionate about environmental sustainability. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p> -->

			<p class = "Bio">Abhijit began his career as a developer, upon completion of a Computer Science undergraduate degree. After a few years of programming, Abhijit opted to make a foray into less technical roles in order to become more well-rounded and gain insight into the business world. Having honed his business/soft skills, Abhijit pursued his MBA. Following various analytical roles, Abhijit is currently pivoting back into technical roles in order to pursue his love of building things and applying technology to solve real world problems. Personally, Abhijit is an environmental sustainability enthusiast and trivia afficionado.
